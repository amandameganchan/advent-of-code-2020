# advent-of-code-2020  
  
my solutions for some of the challenges from Advent of Code 2020 (https://adventofcode.com/2020), an advent calendar of small programming puzzles released in December in the leadup to Christmas!
* first four days are written in bash; rest are done with Python
* days 1-15 have more extensive documentation and comments than 16 onwards
* each day has two parts, sometimes both are in the same code file and sometimes they are separate (e.g. dayXXcode.py and dayXXcode2.py)
